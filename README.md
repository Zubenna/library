## Library App

This is a library application designed to store book objects in an array. Records are stored using the JavaScript localStorage. Users enter records in this application by clicking on the Add Book button shown at the top of the page. This button opens a form where users will be required to enter the book title, author, number of pages, and select read status. By clicking submit, the record is displayed below the button. Users should not store a book with the same title twice. Duplicate records are not permitted.
